.TH VISUDO 8
.SH NAME
visudo \- edit the sudoers file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B visudo
[
.B \-V
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B visudo
edits the
.I sudoers
file in a safe fashion, analogous to
.BR vipw (8).
.B visudo
locks the
.I sudoers
file against multiple simultaneous edits, provides basic sanity checks,
and checks for parse errors.  If the
.I sudoers
file is currently being edited you will receive a message to try
again later.  In the default configuration, the
.BR vi (1)
editor is used, but there is a compile time option to allow use
of whatever editor the environmental variables EDITOR or VISUAL are
set to.
.sp
.B visudo
parses the
.I sudoers
file after the edit and will not save the changes if there is a
syntax error.  Upon finding an error, a message will be printed
stating the line number(s) that the error occurred on
and the user will receive the "What now?" prompt.  At this point
the user may enter "e" to re-edit the
.I sudoers
file, enter "x" to exit without saving the changes, or "q" to quit
and save changes.  The "q" option should be used with extreme care
because if
.B visudo
believes there to be a parse error, so will
.B sudo
and no one will be able to execute
.B sudo
again until the error is fixed.  Any other command at this prompt will print
a short help message.  When editing the
.I sudoers
file after a parse error has been detected the cursor will be placed on the
line where the error occurred (if the editor supports this feature).
.SH OPTIONS
.B visudo
accepts the following command line option:
.IP -V
The -V (version) option causes visudo to print the version number
and exit.

program.
