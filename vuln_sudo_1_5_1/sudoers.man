.TH SUDOERS 5
.SH NAME
sudoers \- list of which users may execute what as root
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I sudoers
file is composed of an optional host alias section, an optional command
alias section and the user specification section. All command or host
aliases need to start with their respective keywords
(ie: Host_Alias, User_Alias, or Cmnd_Alias).
If there are multiple occurrences of a user, the union of the entries
will be used.
.nf

user specification format: 
  user access_group [: access_group] ...

    access_group ::= host_type = [op]cmnd_type [,[op]cmnd_type] ... 
       host_type ::= a lower\-case hostname, netgroup, ip address,
		           network number, or host alias.
       cmnd_type ::= an command OR a command alias.
              op ::= the logical '!' NOT operator.

host alias section format:
  Host_Alias HOSTALIAS = host\-list

      Host_Alias ::= a keyword.
       HOSTALIAS ::= an upper\-case alias name.
       host\-list ::= a comma separated list of hosts, netgroups,
			      ip addresses, networks.

user alias section format:
  User_Alias USERALIAS = user\-list

      User_Alias ::= a keyword.
       USERALIAS ::= an upper\-case alias name.
       user\-list ::= a comma separated list of users, groups and netgroups.

command alias section format:
  Cmnd_Alias CMNDALIAS = cmnd\-list

      Cmnd_Alias ::= a keyword.
       CMNDALIAS ::= an upper\-case alias name.
       cmnd\-list ::= a comma separated list commands.

command specification:
  path arg1 arg2 .. argn = command

            path ::= a fully qualified pathname.
       arg[1..n] ::= optional command line arguments.

    Text after a pound sign ('#') is considered a comment.
    Words that begin with a percent sign ('%') are assumed to
    be UN*X groups (%staff refers to users in the group "staff").
    Words that begin with a plus sign ('+') are assumed to
    be netgroups (+cshosts refers to the netgroup "cshosts").
    Long lines can be newline escaped with the backslash '\\' character.
    The reserved alias 'ALL' can be used for both {Host,User,Cmnd}_Alias.

    DO NOT define an alias of 'ALL', it will NOT be used.
    Note that 'ALL' implies the entire universe of hosts/users/commands.
    You can subtract elements from the universe by using the syntax:
       user  host=ALL,!ALIAS1,!/etc/halt...
    Note that the '!' notation only works in a user's command list.  You
    may not use it to subtract elements in a User_Alias, Host_Alias, or
    Cmnd_Alias.

    Commands may have optional command line arguments.  If they do,
    then the arguments in the sudoers file must exactly match those
    on the command line.  It is also possible to have a command's
    arguments span multiple lines as long as the line continuance
    character '\\' is used.  The following characters must be escaped
    with a '\\' if used in command arguments: ',', ':', '=', '\\'.

.sp
The above
.I sudoers
file specification is composed of 4 host alias specifications, 2 user alias
specifications, 4 command alias specifications and 8 user specifications.  Full
time staff (those in the FULLTIME alias) and anyone in group "wheel" are
allowed to execute any command on any host.  Part time staff (those in the
PARTTIME alias) are allowed to execute any command except for the group of
SHELL and SU commands on any machine.  Britt is permitted to execute /etc/halt,
/etc/shutdown, /usr/etc/lpc and /usr/ucb/lprm on the REMOTE machines (merlin,
kodiakthorn, and spirit).  Nieusma is allowed to run /etc/halt, /etc/shutdown,
and /etc/halt on all machines and all commands except for the group of SHELL
commands on the HUB machines.  Jill is permitted to execute /etc/shutdown with
the "\-r now" flags, /bin/rm, and /bin/cat on houdini.  Davehieb can execute
any command on machines merlin and kodiakthorn and can halt the SERVERS.  Any
user in the netgroup "interns" may run any command on the machines in the
netgroup "openlabs" except for those commands in the groups SHELL and SU.
Steve can run any command located in the directory /usr/op_commands on all
machines on the subnets listed in CSNETS (note that the 128.138.192 net has
a netmask of 255.255.255.192 which is why its network number is
128.138.192.192).  He may also su to operator but to no one else.

.sp
.B sudo
will do a logical and of a machine's ip address(es) with its netmask to decide
whether that machine is on a given network).
.sp
The
.I sudoers
file should 
.B always
be edited by the 
.B visudo 
command which locks the file and does grammatical checking. It is
imperative that the
.I sudoers
be free of syntax errors since sudo will not run with a syntactically
incorrect sudoers file.
